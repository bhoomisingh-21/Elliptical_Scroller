Elliptical Scroller ðŸŽ 

This project is a responsive infinite scroller built with React and Vite. The application leverages modern web development tools and techniques to ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Features
ðŸŒŸ Infinite scrolling of images with smooth animations.

ðŸŽ¨ Designed with Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive UI.

âš¡ Built using Vite for fast builds and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

ðŸ”§ Custom animations and styles using CSS and keyframes.
